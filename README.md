# Fake Speech Detection Using AI

## Overview

This repository explores the detection of fake or AI-generated speech using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The main focus is on research and experimentation rather than providing a production-ready pipeline. The project is primarily implemented through Jupyter Notebooks, which document data exploration, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation steps. A final report summarizing the methodology and findings is also included.
